    <!-- Proof Writing - Odd/Even -->
    <div class="answer">
        1. Proof Writing - Odd/Even:  
        We want to prove that the product of two odd numbers is always odd.
        <br><br>
        **Proof:**
        <br> Let the two odd numbers be written as a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1 for some integers m and n. Their product is:
        <br>
        a × b = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 = 2(2mn + m + n) + 1
        <br>
        Since this result is in the form 2k + 1, where k = 2mn + m + n, this is the general form of an odd number. Therefore, the product of two odd numbers is always odd.

        2. Proof Structure Completion - Complex Fill-in-the-Blank:  
        We want to prove that the sum of the squares of three consecutive odd numbers is even.
        <br><br>
        **Proof:**
        <br> Let the three consecutive odd numbers be (n - 2), n, and (n + 2). Their squares are:
        <br>
        (n - 2)<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + (n + 2)<sup>2</sup> = n<sup>2</sup> - 4n + 4 + n<sup>2</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + 4n + 4 = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 8
        <br>
        Since 3n<sup>2</sup> + 8 is always even (because 3n<sup>2</sup> is divisible by 2 and 8 is an even number), the sum of the squares of three consecutive odd numbers is always even.

    <!-- Induction Proof - Detailed -->
    <div class="answer">
        3. Induction Proof - Difficult Version:  
        We want to prove by induction that the sum of the squares of even numbers from 1 to 2n is equal to n(2n + 1)(n + 1) / 3.
        <br><br>
        **Step 1: Base Case**  
        For n = 1, the sum of squares of even numbers from 1 to 2n is just:
        <br>
        2<sup>2</sup> = 4
        <br>
        The formula on the right-hand side for n = 1 is:
        <br>
        (1(2(1) + 1)(1 + 1)) / 3 = (1 × 3 × 2) / 3 = 4
        <br>
        Since both sides are equal, the base case holds.
        <br><br>
        **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**  
        Assume that the formula holds for n = k. That is:
        <br>
        2<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> + ... + (2k)<sup>2</sup> = (k(2k + 1)(k + 1)) / 3
        <br><br>
        **Step 3: Inductive Step**  
        Consider the sum of squares for n = k + 1, which means adding (2(k + 1))<sup>2</sup> to the inductive hypothesis:
        <br>
        2<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup> + ... + (2k)<sup>2</sup> + (2(k + 1))<sup>2</sup>
        <br>
        Using the inductive hypothesis, we can write:
        <br>
        (k(2k + 1)(k + 1)) / 3 + (2(k + 1))<sup>2</sup>
        <br>
        Simplifying (2(k + 1))<sup>2</sup> = 4(k + 1)<sup>2</sup>, we get:
        <br>
        (k(2k + 1)(k + 1)) / 3 + 4(k + 1)<sup>2</sup>
        <br>
        Factor out (k + 1):
        <br>
        (k + 1) × [(k(2k + 1)) / 3 + 4(k + 1)]
        <br>
        Simplifying inside the parentheses:
        <br>
        (k + 1) × [(2k<sup>2</sup> + k + 12k + 12) / 3] = (k + 1)(2k<sup>2</sup> + 13k + 12) / 3
        <br>
        This matches the original formula for n = k + 1:
        <br>
        (k + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)((k + 1) + 1) / 3
        <br>
        Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof by induction.

        <div class="answer">
            1. Use Modus Tollens to prove ¬p:
            <br> From ¬r and q → r, we can infer ¬q. Then from ¬q and p → q, we can infer ¬p.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            2. Invalid Inference - Fallacy:  
            The inference is invalid because it commits the fallacy of "affirming the consequent." From \(p → q\) and \(q\), you cannot conclude \(p\).
